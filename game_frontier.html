        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A singleplayer management game made in 14 days for the 2024 Pirate
          Software Game Jam. It can be played in the browser
          <a href="https://tiki720.itch.io/frontier">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frontier was designed around the game jam's theme of "It's Spreading."
          As such, you represent the main computer of a sleeper ship, destined
          to colonize the TRAPPIST-1 solar system. To accomplish this goal, you
          need to balance the inputs and outputs of the various systems on the
          ship. The Pathfinder IV must survive dangerous encouters in open
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retrospect, the concept was overambitious, however I learned the
          limits of what I can complete as a solo developer.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          The premise behind the gameplay was that the player should be guided
          into dilemmas, where they have to make a decision that will impact the
          course of the game. With this in mind, the game was structured around
          an event timeline system, which allows the player to select a reaction
          to the event's effects. For example, one of the suspension decks
          fails, waking a large amount of crew who were prepared to sleep the
          entire journey. The options for this scenario are to put them all back
          to sleep, or make use of their skills in maintaining the ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          To accomplish this premise, an in-depth UI system was required, the
          current implemented functionality is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resource network view, with input and output statistics.</li>
          <li>Ship system inspection, with boosting minigames.</li>
          <li>Crew management and relocation between systems.</li>
          <li>Event popup section and detailed view avaliable.</li>
          <li>Timeline showing future events.</li>
          <li>And lastly, a play, pause, and fast forward system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To create the dynamic UI, over 6,000 lines of custom code were needed,
          in addition to the unique 2D art assets, and interaction sound
          effects. The result is lacking a tutorial, and the depth of events
          that I had planned, but most of the core gameplay is in place.

        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>
          The facet of making the game that I learned the most from was the 3D
          art. I have significant experience with modelling software like
          SolidWorks, but Blender has a very different workflow. However, I
          think the end result fits in well with what I wanted out of Frontier.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am most proud of the suble emission textures and lighting effects,
          that help the model feel real, within the detail limits imposed by
          browser rendering with OpenGL.

        <p>
          Another challenge I encountered was making the icons legible on the
          target resolution of 960x600. This took a lot of trial and error, and
          designing distinct shaped an geometries for important sprites.

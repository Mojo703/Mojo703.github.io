      <h2>Robot Soccer Mechanics Team</h2>
      <p>
        Designed to compete in the 2024
        <a href="https://ssl.robocup.org/">robocup small size league</a>. Our
        team's website is
        <a href="https://www.sfurobotsoccer.com/">SFU Robot Soccer</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I rendered the robot soccer mechanical components in SolidWorks. I have
        personally designed or revised many of the mechanical components of the
        robot, most notably the spiral-shaped dribbler, its drive train
        assembly, the horizontal structural plates, and the main mounting
        brackets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team's prototyping is done with 3D printing since it is rapid and
        strong enough to do limited testing. To meet our goals, I printed the
        yellow parts with PETG.

      <p>
        Below are some screenshots of my game development projects. The first
        image showcases a fog of war shaders and robust selection tools. The
        second is a game with fully developed gameplay. And finally, the third
        project was developed with my friends, with a limited colour palette and
        procedural animations.

      <h2>Class Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The first image is a hand-soldered digital dice circuit (for the SFU
        class ENSC 220) with through-hole and surface mount components. The end
        result simulates rolling a die when you press the capacitive button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second and third images are of an automatic window actuation system
        controlled by weather forecast (for the SFU classes ENSC 100 and ENSC
        105W). The project was completed from the ground up in a small team,
        with the goal of solving a problem we encounter in the world.

      <p>
        These images show some iterations of a tiny pocket-watch-like mechanism.
        As a design requirement, 3D printing was the manufacturing method.

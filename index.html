      <h2>Who am I:</h2>
      <p>
        I am a third year Computer Engineering major at Simon Fraser University. My largest interests are game development, hiking, and reading.
        My most significant passion is for connecting the complexity of software, with the boundless art of mechanical design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Overtime, my projects have progressed from building cardboard forts, creating massive popsicle stick boats, and making lightweight gliders.
        In the present, I work on multiplayer game development, mechanical design for robots to play soccer, and learning my classes through action and experience instead of memorization.
      </p>

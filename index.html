      <h2>Robot Soccer Mechanics Team</h2>
      <p>
        Designed to compete in the 2024
        <a href="https://ssl.robocup.org/">robocup small size league</a>. Our
        team's website:
        <a href="https://www.sfurobotsoccer.com/">SFU Robot Soccer</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I rendered the robot soccer mechanical components in solidworks. I have
        personally designed or revised many of the mechanical components on the
        robot, most notably the spiral shaped dribbler assembly, and the
        horizontal structural plates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team's prototyping is done with 3D printing, as it is rapid, and
        strong enough to do limited testing. To meet our goals, I printed the
        yellow parts with PETG.

      <h2>Personal Software Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Some screenshots of my game development projects. Showcasing a fog of
        war shader, and robust selection tools. Fully developed gameplay. And
        finally, a project with my friends, with a limited color palette, and
        procedural animations.

      <h2>Class Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The first image is a hand soldered digital dice circuit (for the SFU
        class ENSC 220) with through-hole, and surface mount components. The end
        result simulates rolling a dice when the capacitive button is pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second and third images are of an automatic window actuation system
        controlled by weather forecast (for the SFU classes ENSC 100 and ENSC
        105W). The project was completed from the ground up in a small team,
        with the goal to solve a problem in the world.

      <h2>Personal Mechanical Projects</h2>
      <p>
        These images show some iterations of a very small pocket-watch-like
        mechanism. A design requirement was that it must be manufactured with 3D
        printing.
